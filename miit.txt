project problem statement for keylogger
Problem Statement: In today's digital age, where cybersecurity threats loom large, one of the significant concerns is the proliferation of keyloggers, stealthy software tools designed to monitor and record keystrokes on a user's computer without their knowledge. Keyloggers pose a severe threat to individuals and organizations as they can capture sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, and other personal data, leading to identity theft, financial loss, and privacy breaches.
